# Introduction
**This repository serves as  an undergraduate senior project conducted in the Mechanical Engineering Department at National Central University.**  

The project goal is to enhance the overall processing efficiency for various orders at the FESTO factory.  
To accomplish this, we utilize deep learning techniques to estimate the non-linear processing times for different manufacturing processes. Subsequently, the obtained estimation results are fed into a constrained optimization solver, which then calculates the schedule for the current order.

Our code is avalible [here](./src/).  
If you are interested in the project details, welcome to check our [report](./doc/_FESTO排程_成果報告書.pdf) and [other materials](./doc/) in Chinese.
